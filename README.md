Whitepaper on Topological Federation of document sharing

**Discussion around a permanent name can be found [here](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.WTF/issues/1).**

This IHE whitepaper expands on the existing HIE whitepaper by exploring strategies for integrating multiple document sharing communities into one federated exchange ecosystem with wide and comprehensive reach at the national or global level. Readers are expected to be familiar with the concepts and ideas presented in the HIE whitepaper, as those concepts will be used and expanded upon here.
